Docker is 3 years old. [By clicking you can read the blog](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-birthday-3-thanks-all/) They organized an special event (half tutorial, half contest) for its 3rd birthday.

Basically, to start an application using basic docker skills and also docker-compose. After that, we need to upload those images that we have built into dockerhub account. Step by step instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/docker/docker-birthday-3/blob/master/tutorial.md).

The first thing that I've done is to inspect Turkey for anyone who has participated into this event, because our neighbour Greece has already 18 participants. But, I didn't see any participant in Turkey, so I prepared the image and uploaded it to dockerhub. It took nearly an hour but I liked that. There should be some Turkish participants on that map.

Docker is growing, but Turkey doesn't give much attention to it so far. I think usage of docker will increase soon. Especially when awareness of Devops Engineering increases.

Let's come to the results, Python is way ahead, I admit that tutorial is all about Python, but in this ecosystem which devops engineers also participate, it will be way ahead for a long time.

For those who say "how does this man know all about?" [Dockerize](https://dockerize.it/)
